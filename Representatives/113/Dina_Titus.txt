She previously served as U.S. Representative for {{ushr|NV|3}} from 2009 to 2011, when she was defeated by [[Joe Heck]]. In 2012, she ran successfully for {{ushr|NV|1}}. Titus is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. She previously served in the [[Nevada Senate]] and was that body's [[minority leader]] from 1993 to 2009. Prior to her election to Congress, Titus was an active professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV). She taught American and Nevada government at UNLV for 30 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nTitus was born in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] to parents of Greek descent and raised as Greek Orthodox. She grew up in [[Tifton, Georgia|Tifton]]. Her first exposure to politics came at an early age, when her father, Joe Titus, ran for the Tifton City Council. Her uncle, Theo Titus, served in the Georgia House of Representatives for many years.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About Dina Titus|url=http://www.dinatitus.com/about-dina-titus|work=Elect Dina Titus for U.S. Congress|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> She attended a summer program at [[The College of William & Mary]] and was admitted full-time for the fall - without a high school diploma. There, she studied political science. After earning her bachelor's degree from William and Mary, Titus went on to earn a master's degree from the [[University of Georgia]] and a Ph.D. from [[Florida State University]].<ref name=about/>\n\n==Academic career==\nAfter a year teaching at [[North Texas State University]], Titus moved to Nevada and a faculty position in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).  Over the past 30 years, her students have included a virtual who's-who list in Nevada government, public service and legal circles, and the popularity of her classes is reflected in the teaching-related awards she has received.<ref name=about/> She created and continues to coordinate the Legislative Internship Program at UNLV, which each session affords the opportunity for a group of students to work at the Legislature.\n\n==Nevada Senate==\nFirst elected in 1988, Titus served for 20 years in the [[Nevada Senate]], representing the Clark 7th District. Her major achievements from the 2007 session included:\n\n===Access to vaccines===\nTitus authored a bill that requires health insurance companies to cover the costs of the HPV vaccine, [[Gardasil]].

The bill passed the Nevada Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].  Credit Card providers Citibank and Chase rolled back or eliminated universal default clauses due to political pressure in the U.S. Congress.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fehd|first=Amanda|title=Bill targeting high credit card rates goes to governor|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20070517/ELECTIONS/105170095|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=Nevada Appeal|date=17 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Measure to care for pets in emergencies===\nTitus authored the bill that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators [[Randolph Townsend]] and [[Valerie Wiener]]. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: ''\"We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida ...  When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a disaster victim to leave behind a beloved pet - a member of their family - is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time.\"''<ref>[http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6144412 Dina Titus introduces measure to care for pets.]</ref> The bill was signed into law in June 2007.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Legislation===\nTitus has sponsored 37 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Titus's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/dina-titus/1940?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Titus%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====111th Congress (2009-2010)====\n* H.R. 3164, a bill to expand the tax credit for classroom expenses for teachers, and to have the credit adjust to inflation annually, introduced September 9, 2009\n* H.R. 3952, a bill to increase the allowable deduction from 50% to 80% of business meal and entertainment expenses for businesses that employee an average of less than 50 employees in a single taxable year, introduced October 28, 2009\n* H.R. 5518, a bill to allow for an energy tax credit for expenses for investment in equipment used uses natural gas to heat or cool a structure, and to allow for a natural gas heat pump property credit for 30% of natural gas heat pump property (which the bill defines) expenses, introduced June 10, 2010\n\n====113th Congress (2013-2014)====\n* H.R. 2086, a bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide disability payments during any period in which an individuals disability is being adjusted for disabilities for which the Secretary has already made a decision of whether to provide benefits, introduced May 22, 2013\n* [[To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide veterans with counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training (H.R. 2527; 113th Congress)|H.R. 2527]], a bill to extend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care and counseling program for [[military sexual trauma]] to veterans who experienced such trauma during active duty or training, introduced June 26, 2013.
