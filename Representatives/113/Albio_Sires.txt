Sires then entered the race to succeed him.  He ran in two Democratic primary elections on June 6, 2006--a special primary for the last two months of Menendez' seventh term, and a regular primary for a full two-year term.\n\nIn the special primary to fill the remaining two months, Sires won approximately 90% of the vote, defeating James Geron.  This all but assured Sires of being the next congressman from this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district.  In the regular primary, Sires beat Assemblyman and [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]] Mayor [[Joseph Vas]] in a bitter primary. Sires defeated Vas 68% to 32% and won in Union, Hudson and Essex Counties, while Vas bested Sires in Middlesex County.  No Republican even filed, assuring Sires of a full term.  However, the 13th is so heavily Democratic that any Republican who opted to file would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event.\n\nSires faced Republican [[John Guarini]] \u2014 a salesman and second cousin of former Congressman [[Frank J. Guarini]] (1979\u201393) \u2014 who was unopposed for the GOP nomination. Vas did not seek the unexpired term seat.
