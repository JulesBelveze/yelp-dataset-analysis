Doyle''' (born August 5, 1953) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|PA|14}}, serving in Congress since 1995, making him the Congressman from Pennsylvania with the most seniority, and the dean of the state's Congressional Delegation. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and includes most of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]].\n\nA native of [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]] and graduate of the [[Pennsylvania State University]], Doyle previously served as a member of the Swissvale Borough Council (1977\u20131981) and an aide to state Senator [[Frank Pecora]] (1979\u20131994). He was first elected to Congress in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 Congressional election]].\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nDoyle was born in [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]], [[Pennsylvania]], to [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Italy|Italian]] parents. He graduated from Swissvale Area High School in 1971, and then enrolled at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. He worked in [[steel mill]]s during his summers in college, and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in Community Development in 1975.\n\nAfter college, he worked as executive director of Turtle Creek Valley Citizens Union (1977\u20131979) and was elected to the Swissvale Borough Council in 1977. In 1979, he began work as [[chief of staff]] to [[Pennsylvania State Senate|Pennsylvania State Senator]] [[Frank Pecora]]. Like Pecora, Doyle was once a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who later switched parties to become a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. In addition to his work for Pecora, he joined Eastgate Insurance Company as an insurance agent in 1982.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Committee assignments===\n*'''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]'''\n**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]]\n**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]\n\n===Caucus Memberships===\n*[[Congressional Arts Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|author=|url=https://artscaucus-slaughter.house.gov/membership|format=|publisher=Congressional Arts Caucus|date=|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref>\n*Congressional Autism Caucus\n*Congressional Steel Caucus\n*Congressional Human Rights Caucus\n*Congressional Internet Caucus\n*House Robotics Caucus\n*[[Ohio River Basin Congressional Caucus]]\n\n==Political positions==\nDoyle voted against authorizing [[2003 invasion of Iraq|military force in Iraq]] and against the $87 billion emergency spending bill to fund US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The incumbent Republican, [[Rick Santorum]], was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. Doyle won by almost 10 points, in one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Democrats. He was reelected three times with no substantive opposition.\n\nIn 2002, the Pennsylvania state legislature reconfigured Doyle's district, combining it with the Pittsburgh-based district of fellow Democrat [[William J. Coyne]].  In the process, the state legislature redrew most of western Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic areas into just two districts\u2014the reconfigured 14th District and the 12th District of [[John Murtha]].  The potentially explosive situation of having two Democratic [[incumbent]]s face each other in the primary was defused when Coyne announced his retirement (even though the district contained more of Coyne's former territory than Doyle's) leaving Doyle as the sole incumbent. The new district is by far the most Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, and Doyle was completely unopposed in 2002 and 2004; in 2006 and 2008, his only opposition was [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate [[Titus North]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06312/736544-177.stm | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | title = Anti-GOP tide costs Rep.
