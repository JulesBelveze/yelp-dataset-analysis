This Act seeks to both improve education in the nation's public schools and to protect the environment by \"creating a new environmental education grant program, providing teacher training for environmental education, and including environmental education as an authorized activity under the Fund for the Improvement of Education.\"<ref name=\"SiteBio\" /> NCLI also requires states that participate in the environmental education grant programs to develop a plan to ensure that high school graduates are environmentally literate. This legislation is supported by a \"coalition of over 1200 local, regional, and national organizations representing millions of concerned citizens who are anxious to see a new commitment to environmental education.\"<ref name=\"SiteBio\" />\n\n==Political campaigns==\n[[Image:John sarbanes swearing in.jpg|thumb|left|John Sarbanes at his swearing-in ceremony gesturing towards his father on the far left, former Senator Paul Sarbanes]]\n{{See also|Maryland Congressional election, 2006}}\nSarbanes sought the Democratic nomination for Maryland's 3rd congressional district after 10-term incumbent [[Ben Cardin]] gave up the seat to run for the Senate seat of John Sarbanes' father, Paul Sarbanes. The primary campaign included State Senator [[Paula Hollinger]], former Baltimore City Health Commissioner Peter Beilenson, and former Maryland Democratic Party Treasurer Oz Bengur. Sarbanes won the nomination on September 12, 2006 with 31.9% of the vote. His Republican opponent in the general election was Annapolis marketing executive John White. However, the 3rd is a heavily Democratic district that has been in that party's hands since 1927, and few expected Sarbanes to have much difficulty in the election.  Sarbanes also benefited from name recognition; his father represented the district from 1971 to 1977. On November 7, 2006, Sarbanes won the general election with 64% of the vote, while White received 34% of the vote and Libertarian Charles Curtis McPeek received 2%.  He has been reelected four times with no substantive opposition.\n\n[[File:Sarbanes and Dixon cutting ribbon at 2007 Baltimore Greek Independence Day Parade.jpg|thumb|right|Sarbanes and Baltimore Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] cut the parade ribbon at the 2007 Baltimore Greek Independence Day Parade.]]\n\n===Campaign finance===\nIn the 2008 election cycle, the Sarbanes campaign's income totaled $1,012,936 and his campaign spent $799,506.<ref name=\"finance1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/finance.php?can_id=66575|title=Representative John P.
