In 2009, NIFA published a report titled \"Review of the May 1, 2009 Nassau County Multi-Year Financial Plan Update and Related Matters\".<ref>Thomas Suozzi official photo.jpg</ref> According to NIFA's report, Suozzi had prepared a 2009 budget that did not address the current budget gap, nor did the Multi-Year Financial Plan address a continuing baseline gap in the Out-Years. The Plan assumed optimistic rates of recovery and growth despite the ongoing crises affecting the nation and high levels of unemployment. The report also claims that Suozzi and the County have underestimated Nassau's greater exposure to the economic downturn from Wall Street job losses, and have used $23 million in bond proceeds and reserves to pay operating expenses. The report noted the large amount of turnover in the county Office of Management and Budget, which has not helped Nassau's recovery and planning efforts. By deferring debt service payments and not paying off obligations in a timely manner, Suozzi and the County put taxpayers at risk. Suozzi reportedly planned for Nassau County to use $28 Million of bond proceeds to pay for Fiscal Year 2009's tax assessment grievance refunds. The county would receive $80 million over the next two years in non-recurring federal stimulus monies, which the county would  use to subsidize the operating budget.<ref>[http://www.nifa.state.ny.us/reports_financial/May2009Update.pdf NIFA report (May 2009), nifa.state.ny.us; accessed December 18, 2016.]</ref>\n\n===2009 Nassau County executive election===\nSuozzi lost the 2009 county executive election to Ed Mangano.\n\n===2013 Nassau County executive election===\nAfter first working in the private sector as an attorney, Suozzi announced that he would seek a rematch against Mangano in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Suozzi lays out campaign strategy, six months out|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle-1.812042/suozzi-lays-out-campaign-strategy-six-months-out-1.5216532|publisher=Newsday|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> He attacked Mangano for \"presiding over a decline in the county\", while also emphasizing that, while he was County Executive, Suozzi had eight years of balanced budgets and reduced crime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi Wants His Old Job Back: Says He's Over Losing The First Time And Is What's Right For County This Time |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/02/13/former-nassau-county-executive-tom-suozzi-wants-his-old-job-back|publisher=CBS New York|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> In November, Mangano easily defeated Suozzi, 59 percent to 41.<ref name=\"Twarowski\"/>\n\n===2016 U.S. House campaign===\nIn June 2016, Suozzi won a five-way Democratic primary in [[New York's 3rd congressional district]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brand|first1=Rick|title=Thomas Suozzi savors Democratic primary win |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/thomas-suozzi-savors-democratic-primary-win-1.11986382|website=Newsday.com|publisher=Newsday|accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Suozzi received endorsements from ''The New York Times'', ''Newsday'', and ''The Island Now''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|first1=The New York Times|title=Five Choices in New York Congressional Primaries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/opinion/five-choices-in-new-york-congressional-primaries.html|accessdate=November 4, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=June 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|first1=Newsday|title=Thomas Suozzi to Represent 3rd Congressional District|url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/elect-thomas-suozzi-in-3rd-congressional-district-1.12499930|accessdate=November 4, 2016|publisher=Newsday|date=October 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|first1=The Island Now|title=Our Views: Congressional District 3 Tom Suozzi For Congress|url=http://www.theislandnow.com/opinions/our-views-congressional-district-tom-suozzi-for-congress/article_8f9e797a-a1d1-11e6-a3bd-8f3ebf164084.html|accessdate=November 4, 2016|publisher=The Island Now|date=November 3, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104151805/http://www.theislandnow.com/opinions/our-views-congressional-district-tom-suozzi-for-congress/article_8f9e797a-a1d1-11e6-a3bd-8f3ebf164084.html|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}</ref> He defeated Republican [[Jack Martins]] in the general election on November 8, 2016, and began representing [[New York's 3rd congressional district]] in the [[115th United States Congress]] in January 2017.<ref name=Suozzihousewin/>\n\n===2018 U.S. House campaign===\n\t \nAfter stating that if Trump were to defy court rulings, that \u00b0that's where the second amendment comes in\u2033, the candidate's campaign sought to downplay the town hall meeting assertion.<ref>Berson, Scott.
