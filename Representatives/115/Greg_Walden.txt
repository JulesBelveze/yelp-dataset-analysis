He was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the [[Oregon State Senate]] to fill a vacancy that opened up when [[Wes Cooley]] was elected to the U. S. House. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. However, upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate.  Their son died soon after birth.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980426/NEWS/304269997&cid=sitesearch\n|title=Profile: Walden hopes to snag May 19 GOP primary win\n|last=Wong\n|first=Peter\n|work=[[Mail Tribune]]\n|date=April 26, 1998\n|accessdate=August 25, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nWalden was tapped as campaign manager for Cooley's re-election bid. However, after Cooley was caught in several lies about his military service, Walden was one of many Republicans who called for Cooley to drop out of the race. Walden went as far as to announce he was running for the 2nd District seat as an independent.  However, he served as Oregon state chairman of [[Bob Dole]]'s presidential campaign, and he touted his \"strong Republican credentials\"\u2014implying that he would serve as a Republican if elected. Walden's candidacy led to fears that the Democrats could take advantage of a split in the Republican vote and take a seat they hadn't held since 1981.<ref name=toner>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/18/us/political-briefing-the-states-and-the-issues.html\n|title=Political briefing: the states and the issues\n|last=Toner\n|first=Robin\n|work=[[New York Times]]\n|date=July 18, 1996\n|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>  This ended, however, when Cooley's predecessor, [[Robert Freeman Smith|Bob Smith]], was called out of retirement.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/us/west.html?scp=3&sq=\n|title=The 1996 elections: The states: West\n|work=[[New York Times]]\n|date=November 7, 1996\n|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSmith didn't run for reelection in 1998. Walden easily won the Republican primary and breezed to election in November.  He has been reelected nine times.  Though his district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and his hometown of Hood River, most of the district leans heavily Republican, and Walden has always been reelected easily. In 2002, he defeated [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrat]] [[Peter J. Buckley|Peter Buckley]], who later became a member of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]]. In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2006|2006]], Walden defeated Democratic candidate [[Carol Voisin]], and in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008|2008]] he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and [[Pacific Green Party|Pacific Green]] Tristin Mock.
