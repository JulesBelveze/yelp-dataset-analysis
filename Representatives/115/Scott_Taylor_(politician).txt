Rupe ordered the removal of Shaun Brown's name from the 2nd District ballot. A handwriting expert examined petitions signed by three Taylor staffers. In addition to invalidated signatures, she testified she found ''an overwhelming amount of forgeries on the same sheets.''Rupe confirmed he had found evidence of forgery, uttering, perjury and \"out-and-out fraud.\" \n\nMedia investigations had discovered signatures of deceased voters, and that others no longer resided in the district. Catron, Taylor's campaign consultant, signed an affidavit saying that if he was required to testify, he intended to invoke his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination]] if asked whether he knew there were forged signatures, whether Taylor directed the effort to gather signatures for Brown, and whether there was an attempt to defraud the State Board of Elections. Additionally, four Taylor  staffers signed such affidavits invoking their 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination as the suit progressed, as did Vicki Wilson, who notarized Brown's signature pages. She said she would invoke her 5th Amendment right if called to testify of if she were to be asked if the person who signed the circulator\u2019s affidavit was actually absent when Wilson filled out the notary certificate. Scott Weldon, Taylor's spokesman stated: \"Given that the Democrat lawsuit was purely political and has now successfully excluded Shaun Brown, it\u2019s understandable that individuals would exercise their right not to testify today. Our campaign will continue to cooperate with the investigation and make no further comment while it is ongoing.\" Democratic Party attorney Jeffrey Breit, informed Rupe that there was clear evidence of a pattern and intent by the Taylor campaign to defraud the Virginia Department of Elections. Following the hearing, Breit stated, \"Here is a sitting congressman who sits together with his staff to add a woman charged and indicted for fraud and add her to the ballot for the sole purpose of trying to help his election,\" Ms. Brown additionally faces unrelated criminal federal fraud charges. Breit argued 377 signatures that Taylor's staffers gathered for Brown were forged and should be disallowed, leaving Brown with fewer than the required 1,000 valid signatures to appear on the ballot.
