Located in central Kentucky, the district covers [[Fort Knox]], [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]]. He has served in that role since 2009. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Kentucky Senate]].\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\n\nGuthrie was born in [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], [[Alabama]], the son of Carolyn P. (n\u00e9e Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/guthrie.htm |title=Brett Guthrie ancestry |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[mathematical economics]] from the [[U.S. Military Academy at West Point]] in 1987<ref>[http://www.west-point.org/class/usma1987/content/view/181/60/ ''USMA 1987'' article on Guthrie] retrieved 2008 December 31.</ref> and his Master's of Public and Private Management from [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], in 1997.\n\nGuthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]]. Guthrie has previously served as a [[field artillery]] officer in the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Campbell, Kentucky|Fort Campbell]], Kentucky.\n\n==Kentucky Senate==\nGuthrie represented the 32nd district in the [[Kentucky Senate]] from 1999 to 2008, where he served as vice chairman of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee, and was chairman of the Transportation Committee.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\n;2008\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2008#District 2}}\nIn the 2008 congressional [[general election]], he defeated his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, State Senator [[David Boswell (Kentucky politician)|David Boswell]], for the right to succeed the retiring Republican [[U.S. Representative]] [[Ron Lewis]]. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.\n\nThis set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years.  While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, the voters are very conservative on social issues.  This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election.  Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate [[John McCain]] carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] also carried the 2nd district easily.\n\n;2010\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010#District 2}}\nThe 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2012#District 2}}\nGuthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.\n\n;2018\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2018#District 2}}\nGuthrie filed for re-election on November 27, 2017.
