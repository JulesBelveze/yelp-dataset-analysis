A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he has represented a district based in the state capital and his hometown, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], since 1995, currently numbered as [[Texas's 35th congressional district]].\n\nDoggett received a [[bachelor's degree]] in Business Administration and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]].\n\nDogget has held office as a legislator in the [[Texas State Senate]] and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. He has also held office as a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]], before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n==Early life, education and career==\nBorn in Austin, Doggett received both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Business Administration]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], he also joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity.\n\n==Texas government==\nHis electoral career began in 1973, when he was elected to the [[Texas State Senate]], a position which he filled until 1985.  In 1984, he was the Democratic [[nomination|nominee]] for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the perennial [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[John Tower]], but he lost to the Republican candidate, [[Phil Gramm]]. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing \"cop killer\" bullets and a \"sunset law\" requiring periodic review of government agencies. He gained attention in 1979, as a member of the \"[[Killer Bees (Texas Senate)|Killer Bees]]\" \u2014 a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former [[governor of Texas|governor]] [[John Connally]] a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a [[closed primary]]. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a [[quorum]]. The bill was withdrawn five days later.\n\nIn 1989, he became both a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and an adjunct [[professor]] at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], his [[alma mater]], serving until his election to Congress.\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\nDescribed as an \"endangered species\", Doggett was one of only three white Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being [[Gene Green]] and [[Beto O'Rourke]]) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"Politico Doggett\">{{cite news|title=Is Lloyd Doggett Texas toast?|author= Alex Isenstadt|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59034.html|newspaper= Politico}}</ref> He is one of the most liberal white Democrats from a Southern district, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent Texas in Congress.

The 10th, which had once been represented by [[Lyndon Johnson]], had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.\n\n[[2003 Texas redistricting|Redistricting by the Texas Legislature]] in 2003 split Austin, which had been located entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, among three districts.  Through Republican [[gerrymandering]], Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the [[Houston]] suburbs.  Most of Doggett's former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. It was called \"the [[fajita]] strip\" or \"the [[bacon]] strip\" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and went on to victory in November. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the nearby 23rd District's lines violated the rights of Latino voters.  As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino district\u2014in other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place.  While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.<ref name=\"Decision in LULAC v.

Perry|access-date=March 10, 2010|work=Cornell University Law School}}, which forced the redrawing of the 25th</ref>\n\nDue to the size of the 23rd, the ruling forced the redrawing of five districts between [[El Paso]] and San Antonio, including the 25th. For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the [[University of Texas at Austin]], which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city.  After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010\u2014his closest race since 1996.\n\n;2012\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2012#District 35}}\nIt was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett's district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one.<ref>{{cite news |title= The GOP's big Texas gerrymander|author= Aaron Blake|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-gops-strong-texas-gerrymander/2011/06/02/AGP56VHH_blog.html|newspaper= Washington Post|access-date=June 2, 2011|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>  The new map split Doggett's old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th District stretching from east Austin all the way to the fringes of Fort Worth.  Much of his old base, however, was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin.<ref>[ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/PlanC235/Maps/Individual%20Districts/map_C235_25-36.pdf Map of Texas Congressional districts 25-36]</ref> Doggett's home was located approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.<ref name=AC/>\n\nDoggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, \"The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities \u2014 that is what this is about, as well.\"  He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by \"deny(ing) the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city.\" He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.<ref>{{cite news |title= Doggett: Texas GOP's redistricting plan aims to eliminate white Dems|author=Sean Miller|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/redistricting/165959-doggett-texas-gops-redistricting-plan-aims-to-eliminate-white-dems|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>\n\nDoggett was set to face State Representative [[Joaquin Castro]] in the District 35 primary election. The potential race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro being seen as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later clarified, saying that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doggett vs. Castro: Getting Ugly Already|author=Cindy Casares|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/big-beat/doggett-vs-castro-getting-ugly-already|newspaper= Texas Observer}}</ref> However, Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th District after its incumbent, [[Charlie Gonzalez]], announced his retirement.\n\nDoggett eventually decided to run in the 35th District, facing [[Bexar County]] assessor [[Sylvia Romo]]. Before the primaries, he said that he would move into the district if he were to win. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett has stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wants to \"stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care, and also notes his strong support for both higher education programs and public education.\" By contrast, Romo's campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.<ref name=AC>{{cite news|title= CD 35: Doggett, Romo, Alvarado|author=Michael King|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-05-11/cd-35-doggett-romo-alvarado|newspaper=Austin Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nDoggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title= Election 2012: The Morning After cheat sheet|author=Brad Rollins|url=http://smmercury.com/2012/05/30/election-2012-the-morning-after-cheat-sheet|newspaper=San Marcos Mercury}}</ref> He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented.
