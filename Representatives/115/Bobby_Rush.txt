Rush is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IL|1}}, serving in Congress for more than two decades; he was first elected in 1992 and took office in 1993. He has since won consecutive re-election. The district was located principally on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], with a population from 2003 to early 2013 that was 65% [[African-American]], a higher proportion than any other [[congressional district]] in the nation. In 2011 the [[Illinois General Assembly]] redistricted this area following the 2010 census. While still [[minority-majority]], since early 2013 it is 51.3% African American, 9.8% Latino and 2% Asian. It re-elected Rush in 2016. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Rush is the only politician to have defeated [[Barack Obama]] in an election, which he did in the [[Illinois's 1st congressional district election, 2000|2000 Democratic primary for Illinois' 1st congressional district]]. A civil rights activist during the 1960s, Rush became radicalized for a period and founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]].\n\n==Early life, education, and activism==\nRush was born on November 23, 1946 in [[Albany, Georgia]]. After his parents separated when Rush was 7 years old, his mother took him and his siblings to [[Chicago, Illinois]], joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans out of the South in the first part of the 20th century. In 1963 Rush dropped out of high school before graduating; he joined the [[U.S. Army]]. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went [[AWOL]] from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]]. He later finished his service, receiving an honorable discharge from the Army.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the [[civil rights movement]] and worked in civil disobedience campaigns in the [[southern United States]]. After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]] in 1968, he served as its defense minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/bobby-l.-rush--IL-H|title=Bobby L.

That same year, Rush was elected alderman from the Second Ward on Chicago's South Side. He was a part of the pro-[[Harold Washington]] faction on the Council during the \"[[Council Wars]]\" that began in 1983 following Washington's election as Mayor. The contest became racially polarized, with many white voters supporting a different candidate.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nRush's allies in the black-power movement abandoned the Democrats in the wake of the political turmoil that followed Washington's sudden death in 1987 and formed their own political party, naming it after the late mayor.
