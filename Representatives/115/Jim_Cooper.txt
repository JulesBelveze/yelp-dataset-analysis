The district stretched across five media markets\u2014the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol), Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and [[Huntsville, Alabama]]\u2014so the 1982 race had much of the feel of a statewide race. Owing to the district's demographics, many felt that whoever won the election would almost instantly become a statewide figure with a high potential for election to statewide office in the future.

He was reelected five more times with little substantive opposition, running unopposed in 1986 and 1988. This was somewhat surprising, given the district's volatile demographics. The district, then as now, was split between areas with strong Democratic and Republican voting histories. Indeed, prior to Cooper's election, much of the eastern portion of the 4th hadn't been represented by a Democrat since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

This led to speculation that the legislature might try to draw the 5th out from under Cooper. Indeed, in the summer of 2011 Cooper and [[List of mayors of Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville Mayor]] [[Karl Dean]] told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that they'd heard rumors about heavily Democratic Nashville being split between three Republican districts. Despite its large size, Nashville has been located entirely or mostly in a single district since Reconstruction. Cooper said he'd gotten his hands on a map that would have placed his home in Nashville into the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 6th congressional district|6th District]]. The 5th would have been reconfigured into a strongly Republican district stretching from [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] to the Alabama border, while the rest of Nashville would have been placed in the heavily Republican [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th District]]. Had it been implemented, the map would have left Cooper with only two realistic places to run\u2014an incumbent-versus-incumbent challenge in the 6th against freshman Republican [[Diane Black]], or the reconfigured 5th, which had reportedly been drawn for State Senator and Murfreesboro resident [[Bill Ketron]], chairman of the redistricting committee.<ref>Sisk, Chas.
