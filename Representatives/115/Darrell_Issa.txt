According to Issa, he and his wife pooled their savings, sold their cars (a 1976 Mercedes and a 1967 VW [[Beetle]]) as well as a BMW motorcycle, and borrowed $50,000 from family members to invest in Quantum Enterprises, an electronics manufacturer run by a friend from [[Cleveland Heights]] that assembled [[bug zapper]]s, [[CB radio]] parts, and other consumer products for other companies. One of those clients, [[car alarm]] manufacturer Steal Stopper, would become the path to Issa's fortune. It was struggling badly, and he took control of it by [[foreclosure|foreclosing]] a $60,000 loan he had made to it when its founder, Joey Adkins, missed a payment. Adkins remained as an employee.<ref name=\"Lizza New Yorker story\"/>\n\nIssa soon turned Steal Stopper around, to the point that it was supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] with thousands of car alarms and negotiating a similar deal with [[Toyota]].

An investigation of the cause of the fire noted \"suspicious burn patterns\" with fires starting in two places aided by an [[accelerant]] such as [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Lizza New Yorker story\"/>\n\nAdkins said Issa appeared to prepare for a fire by increasing the [[fire insurance]] policy by 462% three weeks previously, and by removing computer equipment holding accounting and customer information. St. Paul Insurance, suspicious of [[arson]] and [[insurance fraud]], initially paid only $25,000, according to Issa.<ref name=\"Lizza New Yorker story\"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Seabrook |first1=Andrea|title=House Investigator Issa Has Faced Allegations As Well|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/16/150739985/house-investigator-issa-has-faced-allegations-as-well|accessdate=12 September 2016|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR.org|date=April 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Directed Electronics===\n{{main|Directed Electronics}}\nSteal Stopper soon regained its previous prosperity.

In 1985, Issa sold the company to a California-based maker of [[home alarm]]s, and moved to the [[San Diego]] suburb of [[Vista, California|Vista]], where he has lived ever since, to work for the company.
