This was a seriously contested race, receiving a deal of national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. [[Newt Gingrich]] personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won narrowly, 50%\u201348%, becoming only the second Republican to represent this district since Reconstruction. The first, [[James D. Martin|Jim Martin]], was swept into office in what was then the 7th District during the 1964 wave that delivered the state's electoral votes to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Aderholt has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected nine times. He even ran unopposed in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016.\n\nAderholt's increasing margins reflected the growing Republican trend in this part of Alabama. While Democrats still have a majority in voter registration, the district's Democrats are very conservative on social issues, even by Alabama standards. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+30, it is the fifth-most Republican district in the nation and the third-most Republican district east of the Mississippi.\n\n===2010 campaign===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2010#District 4}}\nAderholt was re-elected unopposed.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===2012 campaign===\n{{further|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012#District 4}}\nAderholt was reelected in the November election where he beat [[Alabama House of Representatives|State representative]] [[Daniel Boman]], the Democratic nominee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alabama Secretary of State|url=http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911125014/http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-11|df=}}</ref>\nIn 2012 Aderholt raised $1,207,484.98 for his campaign, but spent only $963,859.15.\nParker Towing was his largest contributor, providing $24,000.00.\n$493,856, 41% of his contributions came from large individual contributions.\n$583,000, 48% came from PACs.{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Defense spending===\nHe does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said \"cuts to defense budgets \u2013 the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility \u2013 shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep.
