(For a detailed account of these elections, see [[Special election musical chairs]].) She won the seat in her own right later that year with 82.8 percent of the vote, and has been reelected nine more times with no substantive opposition in what has long been one of the most Democratic districts in both California and the nation.

She \"warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target'\".<ref>Polner, Murray (March 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref>\n\nLee explained,<blockquote>\"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events\u2014anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration. I could not support such a grant of war-making authority to the president; I believe it would put more innocent lives at risk. The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action\".<ref name=\"Why I opposed AUMF\">{{Cite news |author=Barbara Lee |date=September 23, 2001 |url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Why-I-opposed-the-resolution-to-authorize-force-2876893.php <!--possibly behind paywall: https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-I-opposed-the-resolution-to-authorize-force-2876893.php --> |title=Why I opposed the resolution to authorize force |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref></blockquote>This vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office.
