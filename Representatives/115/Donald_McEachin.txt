A federal court threw out Virginia's original congressional map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A new map saw all of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and most of the majority-black precincts in Henrico County (including McEachin's home), shifted from the 3rd District to the 4th District. The 4th also picked up almost all of Richmond, which had previously been split between the 3rd and 7th Districts. The 4th been represented by Republican [[Randy Forbes]] since a 2001 special election, but the addition of these majority-black areas turned the 4th from a Republican-leaning swing district into a heavily Democratic district. Rather than face certain defeat in the redrawn 4th, Forbes made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in the 2nd District. McEachin defeated Cheasapeake city councilwoman Ella Ward for the Democratic nomination, then handily defeated Republican Henrico County sheriff Mike Wade in the general election.\n\nMcEachin is a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|author=|url=https://cbc.house.gov/membership/|format=|publisher=Congressional Black Caucus|date=|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of African-American United States Representatives]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://mceachin.house.gov/ Congressman A.
