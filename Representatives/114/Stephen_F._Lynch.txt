He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representing [[Massachusetts's 8th congressional district]] which parts of [[Boston]] and many of its southern suburbs. Lynch was previously an [[ironworker]] and [[lawyer]], and served in both chambers of the [[Massachusetts General Court]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[South Boston]], Lynch is the son of an ironworker. He went into the trade after high school, working in an apprenticeship and later joining his father's union. He became the union's youngest president at age 30 while attending the [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]]. He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Boston College Law School]] in 1991.<ref name=\"BC Law Mag\">{{cite web|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&context=bclsm|title=Class gift report 1995-96|work=Boston College Law School Magazine|date=Fall 1996|page=50}}</ref> For several years he worked as a lawyer, primarily representing housing project residents and labor unions. Lynch was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], unseating an incumbent Democratic lawmaker, in 1994. His social views and advocacy for the South Boston neighborhood led him to the [[Massachusetts Senate]] in 1995, when he won a special election to succeed state Senator [[William M. Bulger]].\n\nHe [[Massachusetts's 9th congressional district special election, 2001|won a special election]] to represent the state's [[Massachusetts's 9th congressional district|9th]] district in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2001, and has been re-elected ever since. His district was redrawn into the 8th district in 2013. Lynch has a reputation of being the most [[conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] member of Massachusetts's House delegation, and often votes independently of his party leadership. He currently sits on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Oversight and Government Reform Committee]].  Lynch ran for the Democratic nomination in the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2013|2013 special election for the U.S. Senate]] but lost to [[Ed Markey]].\n\n==Early life, education, and business career==\nLynch, the fourth of six children, was born March 31, 1955, in the neighborhood of [[South Boston]]. He was raised with his five sisters in the [[Old Colony Housing Project]]. His father, Francis Lynch, was an ironworker who had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. His mother, Anne (n\u00e9e Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and [[South Boston High School]]. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice [[ironworker]]. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the United States for various companies, including [[General Motors]] and [[U.S. Steel]].<ref name=\"globe-1997\">{{cite news|last=Kahn|first=Joseph P.|date=May 8, 1997|title=The iron man of Southie: Sen.

He was again arrested in 1979 for assault and battery of six [[Iran]]ian students at an anti-American protest in Boston, a charge which was later dropped. Around this time, he developed \"a problem with alcohol,\" leading him to join [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. (He reportedly stopped after meeting his future wife several years later, although he continued to attend occasional meetings through the 2000s.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/74799016.html?FMT=ABS|last=Abraham|first=Yvonne|title=Lynch discloses arrests in '70s|work=The Boston Globe|date=June 27, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/79097284.html?FMT=ABS|title=In Mass., Short Race Is Long on Variety \u2013 'Unusual Candidates' Hoping to Succeed Rep.

When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in [[Wisconsin]] to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston.<ref name=\"globe-1997\" /> In the early 1980s Lynch was elected to the executive board of the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|Iron Workers Local 7]] union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], from which he graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' with a [[bachelor's degree]] in construction management in 1988.<ref name=\"globe-1997\" />\n\nThat year he led a three-week labor strike, refusing to sign a contract with the Associated General Contractors, <!-- reason? --> despite pressure from within his union. The union international ultimately signed the contract without Lynch's approval, causing him to file suit against them. <!-- result of lawsuit? -->He would later remark, with regard to his political career, \"Nothing I ever do will be as volatile as being union president during those times.\"<ref name=\"globe-1997\" /> This debacle forced him to miss the first three weeks of classes at [[Boston College Law School]], where he had enrolled. Despite the setback, he graduated with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1991. After graduating he joined the law office of Gabriel O. Dumont, Jr., representing labor unions and unemployed workers.<ref name=\"globe-1997\" />\n\nThroughout law school and the following years, he often worked ''pro bono'', representing housing project residents at [[Boston Housing Authority]] (BHA) hearings.<ref name=\"globe-1997\" /> In one high-profile 1994 case, Lynch provided free legal services to 14 teenagers, all white, who were accused of physically attacking a Hispanic teenager and harassing the family of his white girlfriend over a period of six months.

In early 1994 he phoned [[Paul J. Gannon]], the Democratic [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|state representative]] from the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives#Suffolk|4th Suffolk]] district, to announce a run against him.<ref name=\"globe-1997\" /> While both candidates were labor advocates with similar backgrounds, Lynch described himself as \"the conservative candidate\".
