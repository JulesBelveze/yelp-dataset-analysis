In [Bush's] first four years, there was a lack of leadership coming from the administration.

The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to [[Armageddon]] and biblical references that are more their interest.

The 20th is so heavily Democratic that Hostetter faced nearly impossible odds in November. However, she gained notoriety for her attacks on Wasserman Schultz.  For example, Hostetter's campaign site criticized Wasserman Schultz for protesting an [[American flag]] photograph with a [[Christian cross]] on it that was on display in the workstation of a secretary in a government building. Hostetter wrote, \"Elect Margaret Hostetter to Congress November 2 and send the clear message that Americans respect and support... the foundational role [[Christianity]] has had in the formation of our great nation. Our rights come from [[God]], not the state.\" {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWasserman Schultz won, taking 70.2% to Hostetter's 29.8%. However, Hostetter had only spent about $30,000 to get 30% of the vote (compared to Wasserman Schultz's $1.2 million). When Wasserman Schultz was sworn in on January 4, 2005, she chose to use the Hebrew Bible, or [[Tanakh]]. Because Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] only had a Christian Bible, a copy of the Tanakh was borrowed by Hastert's staff from Congressman [[Gary Ackerman]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/5839-rules-take-that-mr-jefferson|date=January 5, 2006|title=Ackerman saves the day|work=The Hill|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref> (This was brought up two years later during the [[Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress]].)<ref>{{cite news|title=Use of Koran in oath splits conservatives|date=January 9, 2007|publisher=Baptist Press|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=24733|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== 2006 ===\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2006}}\nWasserman Schultz was unopposed for reelection in 2006.\n\n=== 2008 ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2016}}\n{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008#District 20}}\nIn 2008 Wasserman Schultz won her reelection bid by defeating Independent Margaret Hostetter and Socialist write-in candidate Marc Luzietti.\n\nShe announced her support of [[Hillary Clinton]] for [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|her party's 2008 presidential nomination]], and in June 2007 was named one of Clinton's national campaign co-chairs.
