In April 2004, Higgins entered the race, and narrowly defeated then-[[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] [[Comptroller]] [[Nancy Naples]]. Even after redistricting following the 2000 census, the district was made slightly friendlier for Quinn (in part, by adding mostly rural Chautauqua County), but was still at the time the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The district has since reverted to form, and Higgins has been reelected three times against Republican opposition, with 2008 and 2010 opponents having posted six-figure fundraising numbers.<ref>[ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/2010/pas210.zip Contributions to candidates and other expenditures from committees, 2010], ''Federal Election Commission'', Washington, DC, 2010, Retrieved 23 March 2014.</ref><ref>[ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/2008/pas208.zip Contributions to candidates and other expenditures from committees, 2008], ''Federal Election Commission'', Washington, DC, 2008, Retrieved 23 March 2014.</ref> In both 2006 and 2008, Higgins garnered more than 70% of the vote.\n\nFor his first four terms, Higgins represented the southern two-thirds of Buffalo, as well as [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]].
